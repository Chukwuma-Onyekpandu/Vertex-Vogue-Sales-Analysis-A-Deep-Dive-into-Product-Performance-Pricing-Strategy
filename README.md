## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes two years of product sales data for Vertex Vogue to uncover patterns in pricing, freight costs, product performance, and customer buying behavior. The goal was to recommend data-driven strategies that optimize revenue and streamline operations.

## 📁 Dataset Summary
- Product sales data across digital and physical platforms
- Includes: Product categories, unit prices, freight charges, product weight, ratings, and descriptions

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed in Excel
- Calculated new metrics like `Revenue` and `Weight Buckets`
- Addressed missing values and validated data types

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Top Revenue Category:** `Health_beauty` ($212,409)
- **Top Sales Volume:** `Garden_tools` (2,532 units)
- **Freight Concern:** `Garden_tools` had highest shipping costs
- **Best Selling Weight Range:** 0–499g
- **No correlation between product score and sales** — price & utility matter more

## 💡 Recommendations
- Reduce freight on heavy items
- Stock more sub-500g products
- Focus marketing efforts on top-performing months (May, August, November)
- Revisit low-performing categories like `Console_games`
- Explore beyond product score as a success metric

## 📷 Visualizations Included
- Revenue & Sales by Category (Bar Charts)
- Monthly Revenue Trends (Line Charts)
- Freight vs. Weight (Scatter)

- Correlation Heatmap of Product Attributes
